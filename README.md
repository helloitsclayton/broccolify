# Broccolify.py

A simple python script to transform a JSON file full of recipes into a `broccoli-archive` file that can be loaded into the Android recipe app [Broccoli](https://github.com/flauschtrud/broccoli).

The only content in `recipes.json` is Broccoli's demo recipe for hummus, and I've updated the script from a previous version to use a flatter JSON schema to match what the Broccoli app exports. The list of recipes is a JSON object, with each recipe's title serving as the key for that recipe's object. This might be a bad idea.

Currently, `broccolify.py` finds recipe images in `img/` by looking for `fileName.jpg`, where `fileName` is generated by stripping punctuation out of the recipe's title and replacing spaces with underscores. Once I figure out how, I'd like it to be more extension-agnostic.

I hope to extend this script to "de-broccolify" an archive exported from the Broccoli app and, if I'm able, develop a method for syncing an exported archive with a local  `recipes.json` file.

## To import:

It's best to clear out your recipes before importing a `broccoli-archive` generated by this script, as otherwise you will end up with lots of duplicate recipes. To do so, navigate to Broccoli's App info via Android's list of apps or by long pressing on the icon and selecting App info. Then tap on "Storage & cache" and "Clear storage". **This will delete all of your recipes**.

In Broccoli, you can then tap the menu, "Backup and restore", and then "Restore recipes" by selected the `broccoli-archive` file generated by this script.
