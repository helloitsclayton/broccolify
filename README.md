# Broccolify.py

A simple python script to transform a JSON file full of recipes into a `broccoli-archive` file that can be loaded into the Android recipe app [Broccoli](https://github.com/flauschtrud/broccoli).

The only content in `recipes.json` is Broccoli's demo recipe for hummus, and I've updated the script from a previous version to use a flatter JSON schema to match what the Broccoli app exports. The list of recipes is a JSON object, with each recipe's title serving as the key for that recipe's object. This might be a bad idea.

Currently, `broccolify.py` finds recipe images in `img/` by looking for `fileName.jpg`, where `fileName` is generated by stripping punctuation out of the recipe's title and replacing spaces with underscores. Once I figure out how, I'd like it to be more extension-agnostic.

I hope to extend this script to "de-broccolify" an archive exported from the Broccoli app and, if I'm able, develop a method for syncing an exported archive with a local  `recipes.json` file.
